# Bloxtor To-Dos (Tasks)

*For instructions on submitting your contributions please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).*

- Create the data-source layer, so developers can use this thrid-party framework. 
	+ Basically create a new Layer called data-source that can have multiple types (eg: Laravel, Symphony, Wordpress, MongoDB, REST-API, SOAP-API, etc...);
	+ This new layer can be related to the Presentation and Business Logic layers;
	+ This new layer will have an Interface for all types and then each type will have the implementation of that interface with correspondent functions.
	+ Allow that the data-source be called and access directly from the url, if the rest  is active. In case of laravel or Wordpress, it will simply redirect the request to these third-party frameworks.
- Integrate Bloxtor with Laravel and Symphony in the data-source layer type.
	+ The idea is to allow the developers from the Presentation and Business Logic layers, to call any controller defined in Laravel/Symphony, by calling '...->getBroker("name of Laravel/Symphony layer")->callController(...)'.
	+ Addionally the developer can access directly the Laravel/Symphony framework, through the url, if this layer has the REST setting activate.
- Integrate Bloxtor with Github so the developer can have code versioning, this is, code versioning for the developer code, the code inside of the 'app' folder. 
- Integrate a chatbot into Bloxtor to help developers understand how the frameworks work and what steps they must follow to achieve their goals.
- Integrate AI in the Page, Template and View editors to create beautiful HTML automatically and add that html to the correspondent region. Imagine a new menu option that opens a popup where developers can describe what they need in natural language, and the framework will generate the relevant code directly into the appropriate section.
- Integrate AI in the Logic Editor to create php code automatically, according with a developer description.
- Integrate AI in the SQL editor to create statements automatically, according with a developer description.
- Integrate AI to create a final app from scratch, where developer writes in natural language what he wants to do, and Bloxtor creates the correspondent code automatically, creating all data-base structures, sql statements, logic and interface code, delivering an app ready to use by the end-user. In the "Create Project" popup, we could add a new tab where developers describe their project requirements in natural language, and Bloxtor takes care the rest.
- Add new widget to the LayoutUIEditor on the Page editor, to allow to create a google maps but with specific icons/pins/axis-graphs based in dynamic data. Create a widget that could be used to show dynamic data in a map.
- Add new feature to allow better reporting from dynamic data fro mthe DB, based in personalized templates.
- Integrate Bloxtor with Zapier, where the user saves its credentials in Bloxtor and logs in to Zappier directly from Bloxtor (through an iframe).
- Integrate Bloxtor with Lucidchart, where the user saves its credentials in Bloxtor and logs in to Lucidchart directly from Bloxtor (through an iframe), to create diagrams.
- Integrate the Github account to be set automatically with the following apps:
	+ Agile apps to help the developers to manage their projects: Zube, ZenHub, Codetree, "Azure Boards" and "GitKraken Boards"; 
	+ Apps to analyse the performance of the developers: DeepAffects, "Ranked development", WakaTime, GitView and Teamlytics; 
	+ Apps to check the code quality: Codacy, DeepSource, "Code Inspector", CodeFactor, "CodeImprover Duplication" and "Code Climate"; 
	+ Apps for easy deployment: Buddy, CircleCI and "CloudBees CodeShip"; 
	+ Apps for monitoring: Rollbar, ZenCrepes and "Meercode | CI Monitoring"; 
	+ Apps to see diagrams on Github: "Lucidchart Connector".
- Redesign the "Citizen Development" workspace and make it available by default.
- Create a new workspace called "Ninja", which is basically a rudimentary file manager to manage all files including .htaccess and other reserved files. The idea is to give the developer permission to edit all files, as if he were connected via ssh.
- Add Foreign Keys syncronization from the DB diagram to DB Server.
- Add a new task in the Logic Editor to perform a calculation on an attribute in a list. eg: if I want to calculate the sum of an attribute from a list of records, instead of creating a diagram with the loop task, I call this new task that calculates the sum of an attribute from that list of records. Something like in Excel.
- In the SLA/Resources section (of the Page editor), Add a new action to perform a calculation on an attribute in a list. eg: if I want to calculate the sum of an attribute from a list of records, I call this new action that calculates the sum of an attribute from that list of records.
- Add the option in the SQL editor to be able to add functions such as sum, count, etc... but in a visual way without the user needing to know these keywords.
- In the Page Editor, find a way to execute functions directly in the html for certain dynamic data. For example: I may want to show the correspondent month, in full text, of a timestamp attribute from a records list. Find a away to do this in a user-friendly and visual way.
- Add FTPManager that allows deployment via FTP, for servers that do not allow SSH. Also prepare deployment code with FTP functionality. When deploying, give the user option to use SSH or FTP.
- add feature to deployment panel where we have a wizard button to create new templates automatically, based in the created layout types. Basically we click in this button, it shows a popup with the created layout types list, the user selects one layout type, and the systems creates automatically the correspondent template with the respective layers and actions for the layout type selected. This is very usefull to quickly export projects to another servers.
- Change the database diagram to allow table alias, then update the entire system to automatically load the table alias instead of asking the user because it's annoying.
- Add websockets to MyJSResourceLib.js where dynamic data from database are automatically updated through websockets to be faster. Basically for each link, create an attribute called “prefetch” which can be:
	+ "intent": communicates with the server and fetches the new page but does not render it. (rendering means creating the final html to be displayed.)
	+ "render": communicates with the server, fetches the new page and renders it.
	+ "none": does not do anything. It is the same than not having this attribute.
	Create this new feature based on certain template regions, where the client only requests the html for certain regions.
	The idea is to make the MyJSResourceLib.js faster than React.js.
- Create search box in the Logic Editor and Page Editor so the developer can find available tasks/widgets easly.
- Create redirect task in the Logic Editor. Basically calls the "header: location" php function.
- Create json_encode and json_decode tasks in the Logic Editor.
- In the SLA/Resources section of the page editor, change the "conditions" input field to be more user-friendly, when this field contains php code. The idea is to convert this user input to no-code, where the developer don't need to write PHP code. Basically, create a code reader and converter for this input field that displays the correspondent code in a friendly way.
- Improve the framework's dark theme.
- Finish the cache settings in the "Advanced Settings Tab" of the Page Editor.
- Change the word "Entity" to "Page" in the phpframework code. Currently an entity is a Page in Bloxtor. However, the people relate "entity" with a database model, which gets confused. So we need to change all files and replace "entity" with "page" word. Also change EVC (Entity-View-Controller) to PVC (Page-View-Controller).
- In the Logic Editor, set the code auto-complete function, which shows multiple options to the developer of the possible code that he can do.

Other tasks will be added as these tasks are completed.
