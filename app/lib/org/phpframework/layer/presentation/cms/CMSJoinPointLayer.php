		If you had to change the $current_block here or in any other method of this class, the addRegionBlockJoinPoint method must be called before the "include $EVC->getBlockPath(block_id);" (in the entity files), or otherwise won't work, because it will loose the correct $block_id value.
		For code flexibility advantages, do NOT change the $current_block method here or in any other method of this class. Leave it in the CMSBlockLayer::createBlock method.
