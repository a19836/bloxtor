# Bloxtor Licensing

Selecting licenses for Bloxtor software was a real pain for our team. On the one hand, we always wanted to make Bloxtor totally open, and on the other hand, we were always thinking about Bloxtor being a self-sufficient project which can reward the team financially. Programmers earn their salary by doing programming job, don't they?

Why did we want to make Bloxtor open? For us it's simple - this is the only way to earn your trust and a way to attract talented people who can help develop the project further.

Ultimately, we started a dedicated company (HLNC - OnlineIT, Lda), wrote and/or acquired the rights over a software license, and started to provide Bloxtor hosting services and software. This is our current business model, in short. And yes - we've been trying to earn our salaries by doing this business and survive based on hosting and support.

So, the situation with Bloxtor software licensing is as follows:
- The source code is open and freely available for inspection, use and modification. You can, for example, build your own versions of the Bloxtor software. This is formalized by the *Source Code Provisions* section which applies to all Bloxtor source code, where you can share your contributions with the community.
- However, you cannot redistribute the source code or the software and you cannot provide hosting services for third parties. These activities require additional arrangements with us, except for some cases. These rules are formalized by the *Freeware Software Provisions* section which applies to all software built from our source code.

As you see, it's something similar to an OSS - Open-Source Software license, but with some restrictions on the "redistribution".

The *Source Code Provisions* and *Freeware Software Provisions* sections can be read below.

Please contact us if you have any questions regarding licensing of Bloxtor software.
