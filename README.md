### History

Bloxtor emerged from the extensive professional experience of its creator, who identified a significant market gap for such a tool. Over many years, he developed and refined various solutions, which culminated in the creation of Bloxtor. The development process began during the creator’s free time while working in various companies, where Bloxtor's early iterations were also utilized. Although its market release was delayed due to its complexity, this allowed for the integration of cutting-edge features, drawing on the creator's professional expertise and the latest technological advancements.

### Mission and Vision

Our **mission** is to offer a comprehensive tool that centralizes the entire web application development process, from planning to maintenance, empowering all users to contribute to the development process. This includes creating UML diagrams, supporting low-code, no-code, and citizen development, and providing deployment systems, unit tests, ticket management, BPM, and CRM systems, all enhanced with artificial intelligence.
Our mission is to create a versatile framework that can be used in any scenario, whether remotely or locally, online or offline, by everyone – both tech-savvy and non-tech individuals. Our tool is designed for use by individuals and companies alike, across all departments, not just IT.
We believe that by creating a framework accessible to everyone - no-coders, low-coders, and coders - we will significantly advance the global web development and leave our mark on the world.

Our **vision** is to make web development faster, more automated, intelligent, and sustainable. We aim to make Bloxtor a go-to tool for low-code, no-code, and citizen development projects, maintaining flexibility even with high levels of code abstraction.
Our vision is to challenge the dominance of big companies in global web development. We dream of claiming a share of their pie by offering a free and transparent alternative to the world.

### Goals

- **Global Reach**: Spread Bloxtor worldwide and build vibrant communities around it, promoting growth within open-source and other target groups.
- **Sustainable Business**: Initially establish a sustainable business, improving and sharing Bloxtor within its communities.
- **Central Repository**: Provide a central repository for web development accessible to everyone.
- **Independent Growth:** See Bloxtor grow independently and become widely used by developers everywhere.
